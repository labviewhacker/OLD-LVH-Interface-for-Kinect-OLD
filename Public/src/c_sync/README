This folder contains modified version of libfreenect_sync.c and libfreenect_sync.h.  To use these files follow the directions here: http://openkinect.org/wiki/Getting_Started#Windows and replace the files in libfreenect-master\wrappers with the coresponding files in this directory.
The changes in these files cause certain functions to be exported when the libfreenect_sync dll is built so they can be called from LabVIEW.  These changes should be considered for inclusion in the Open Kinect project trunk.


** Freenect C Synchronous Interface **
- Brandyn White (bwhite@dappervision.com)
- Andrew Miller (amiller@dappervision.com)

Provides a synchronous interface (e.g., freenect_get_depth and freenect_get_rgb) as opposed to callbacks.  Uses pthreads.  The Cython Syncrhonous interfaces uses these, that is the simplest way to test this.
